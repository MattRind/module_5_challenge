# module_5_challenge
Note: I not only pushed the file containing my code (please see in the pymaceuticals folder, the pymaceuticals.ipynb file), but also all the original folders/files that came with the homework.
I created a new notebook pymaceuticals.ipynb based on the template file (“starter”) that was provided. I used as much code in the provided template as I thought was correct for solving the problem. All code was written by me. Even though I followed the template for the statistical section “Calculate Quartiles, Find Outliers, and Create a Box Plot”, I came up with an alternative method that was based on recent lessons in the classes. There were several bits of code that I had to self-learn, that were also not covered in the classroom, e.g., aggregation method, linregress, side-by-side boxplots, changing the order of barplots, and other plot enhancements (e.g., plot titles).
